* Learnings: This was a good learning opportunity because I had not used HTML canvas element in any of my previous projects. Here, I learned that the HTML canvas element works as the container of graphics and JavaScript is used to actually draw the graphics inside the container. 

By default, canvas has a rectangular shape and no border or content. It also has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and even images!
